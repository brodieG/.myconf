# MacOS Instruments

Been hitting weird issue where e.g. we see:

    Binary file for selected symbol is expected to be here:

This despite the file clearly being there.  The problem is that it won't show
the disassembly side by side with the code.  There are some caching issues with
xcode and varying levels of problems.

Feels like I was able to get this to work eventually at Steamboat, but don't
remember quite what I did.  Might have been messing with where the file is.

Currently I am unable to get this to work.  There were some suggestions about a
dSYM file.  If I disassemble the ".o" file I see the symbols, but not the
corresponding ".so" file.  This was for the r2c generated code files.
