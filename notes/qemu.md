## MIPS

> This is what we settled on after trying several variations.

[Markuta][11] has a guide for buidling MIPS using the [Malta images from
debian][12].  Oddly an exact copy of the post is published under [Hidrasky][13]

After downloading the image, to install (make sure big enough, difficult to grow
the internal partition once OS installed):

```
qemu-img create -f qcow2 hda.img 10G   # 2G small, pain to grow after install

qemu-system-mips -M malta \
  -m 256 -hda hda.img \
  -kernel vmlinux-4.19.0-16-4kc-malta \
  -initrd initrd.gz \
  -append "console=ttyS0 nokaslr" \
  -nographic
```

hostname: qemu-malta

The install takes forever.

**Remember to record root and user name/passwords**

Once we hit the "Installation is complete" dialog we need to kill the VM and
edit the image so it doesn't restart in install mode.

These are straight from Markuta:

Mount the boot partition of the image file.  Not sure what this is doing
exactly.  Seems like the easiest thing to do will be to try to do this via
vagrant so we can use nbd and not have to figure out the equivalent.  Should be
okay since we just want to grab the file.

```
sudo modprobe nbd max_part=63      # init nbd mount?
sudo qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0 hda.img # copy the image to the mount
sudo mount /dev/nbd0p1 /mnt        # mount partition one onto /mnt/
```

Copy a single file or the entire folder to the current directory:

```
cp -r /mnt/boot/initrd.img-4.19.0-16-4kc-malta .

# cp -r initrd.img-4.9.0-6-4kc-malta .            # copy only initrd.img file
# cp -r /mnt/boot .                               # copy the entire boot folder
```

Unmount the image:

```
sudo umount /mnt
sudo qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd0
```

And run:

```
qemu-system-mips -M malta \
  -m 256 -hda hda.img \
  -kernel vmlinux-4.19.0-16-4kc-malta \
  -initrd initrd.img-4.19.0-16-4kc-malta \
  -append "root=/dev/sda1 console=ttyS0 nokaslr" \
  -nographic \
  -device e1000,netdev=net0 -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::5555-:22
```

Old device config below.  Trying Tomas.  e1000 is apparently just an alias.
Networking not working.

```
wget www.google.com    # fails.
```

`/etc/network/interfaces` seems misconfigured.  From `/sys/class/net` we see the
device name to be `enp0s19`, not `enp0s11`.  Also backed up by the startup
message:

```
[   11.289605] e1000 0000:00:13.0 enp0s19: renamed from eth0
```

Changing the device to `enp0s19` seemed to fix it.  Ping doesn't return, but
`apt-get update` works (although extremely slowly - actually, subsequent install
was fast).

```
ip address show enp0s19
2: enp0s19: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:12:34:56 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff```
```

```
  -device e1000-82545em,netdev=user.0 \
  -netdev user,id=user.0,hostfwd=tcp::5555-:22  # should be brodie?
```

The only visible difference I see here is:

    -initrd initrd.img-4.9.0-6-4kc-malta \

Which seems to correspond to that single file.

## Resizing (Get Size Right First Go!)

First time I did this I used a partition way to small to install R.  With the
image shutdown:

    qemu-img resize hda.img +5G

Then log in:

    # sudo apt-get parted
    parted
    p


## General Notes

[Urban Penguin][4] has some info on maybe using cloud-config, but need to figure
out how to do that on OS X.

[Sumit][5] has a detailed explanation of the cloud init process, with perhaps
even enough info that I can figure out how to get it to work on OS X.  If that
fails, we can try to use this strategy to have another way of setting the
username/password info in Ubuntu.

## Big Endian

Wincent tried to do this (big endian on OS X) and failed, but [took notes][6].

Looks like debian is no longer [directly publishing][7] an big endian PPC image:

> Currently, Big Endian PowerPC architectures (powerpc/ppc64) are only
> classified as ports within Debian (a.k.a Debian Ports), meaning neither are an

[ARM not much help][8]:

A [Stephan Brumme post][9] links to an [ancient debian][10] image we might be
able to use.

Trying AurÃ©lien's image:

```
The other installation options are the following:
  - Keyboard:       US
  - Locale:         en_US
  - Mirror:         ftp.debian.org
  - Hostname:       debian-powerpc
  - Root password:  root
  - User account:   user
  - User password:  user
```

```
qemu-system-ppc -hda debian_wheezy_powerpc_standard.qcow2 \
    -nographic \
    -device e1000,netdev=net0 -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::5555-:22
```

Hmm, worked fine except that none of the packages were present, and we don't
even have gcc so that really doesn't work.  Many of the links in the apt are
dead.

## Making Image as per Urban Penguin

> We're configuring the image in Ubuntu, but running it via QEMU on OS X.

Now, let's try the power pc image from the Kalibera post[2].  Can't accelerate
here since archs are different.

I could not get `virt-customize` from Tomas's instructions[2] to work:

```
sudo virt-customize -a ubuntu-18.04-server-cloudimg-ppc64el.img --root-password password:
guestfsd: error while loading shared libraries: libgcc_s.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

Instead, I had to change the password via `cloud-init`, which worked.  Many ways
of setting passwords did not work.  The key was to change the password of root
via `chpasswd`.

```
sudo apt-get install cloud-init
sudo apt install cloud-image-utils
cat << EOF > meta-data
instance-id: instance-0
local-hostname: host5
EOF

cat << EOF > user-data
#cloud-config
chpasswd:
  list: |
     root:password
  expire: False
EOF

sudo cloud-localds cloud-init.iso user-data meta-data
```

And then run `qemu` via OS X.  **Use a fresh image!**.  Each time we do this the
image is modified and the `cloud-init` business will not work anymore.

```
qemu-img resize ubuntu-18.04-server-cloudimg-ppc64el.img 10G
qemu-system-ppc64 \
    -cpu power9 \
    -nographic \
    -smp 2 \
    -m 2G \
    -L pc-bios -boot c \
    -hda ubuntu-18.04-server-cloudimg-ppc64el.img \
    -drive file=cloud-init.iso,format=raw \
    -device e1000,netdev=net0 -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::5555-:22
```

## QEMU Install

Using instructions from [A Koziel][1] (see also neklaf[3]).  Note the
instructions create an empty container to fill from the CD ISO.  For our own use
we don't want that, but this does have the instructions for the QEMU install
proper:

```
brew install qemu  # remember the chown back and forth stuff
```
