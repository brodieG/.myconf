# Reverse Dependencies in Docker

Objective is to create a re-usable docker container with all required system
dependencies that we can re-use to do revdeps.

# Strategy

* Use bspm to install all the packages first so that they system dependencies
  are pulled in.

* Use Rstudio revdepcheck testing second?  This will use the cache, so will try
  to re-install all the packages, but that's okay, we just want to use bspm to
  get the dependencies.

# Creating a Permanent Docker Container


# Starting with Basic Container

Maybe not the best idea to start with this if we intend to do with the Rstudio
package manager given this traces the package.

```
docker pull rocker/r-bspm:20.04
docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/mydir rocker/r-bspm:20.04  # no --rm
```

See 'revdep.Rmd' to get list of packages to install.

Then we tried to manually install all the dependencies.  Many got built from
source, but didn't take too long (probably over an hour though).

We got several outright failures, such as `units`, which just re-installing
worked, and `sf` which died complaining about `gdal`.  Used:

```
apt-get update
apt-get install libgdal-dev libproj-dev
```

Then in R:

```
install.packages(c('s2', 'sf', 'lwgeom', 'sfnetworks'))
```

Some packages were bioconductor, and we didn't bother with those.

Then:
```
remotes::install_github("r-lib/revdepcheck")
bspm::disable()  # to possible conflicts (not checked if this is a problem)
```

Note, disable does not actually disable bpsm(), we need to remove it from the
`/etc/R/Rprofile.site` file because e.g. `revdepcheck` launches sub-processes
that will read that file.

It seems BPSM might be causing packages to be installed from the wrong R
version.

Okay, we gave up on BPSM, trying r-rspm.  Revdep check mysteriously failing.

```
docker pull rocker/r-rspm:20.04
docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/mydir rocker/r-rspm:20.04  # no --rm
apt-get install libgdal-dev libproj-dev libmagick++-dev
```

Upon further research the most likely source of failure seems to be a timeout
that causes all packages after timeout to fail[2].

# Installing BPSM

From [1], although maybe not necessary if we start with a bpsm container.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:marutter/rrutter4.0   # R v4.0 and higher
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:c2d4u.team/c2d4u4.0+  # R packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install r-cran-bspm python3-{dbus,gi,apt}
```

We might not want this; one question is if we don't do this, future installs
still benefit from the installed system packages.

```
echo "bspm::enable()" | sudo tee -a /etc/R/Rprofile.site
```
