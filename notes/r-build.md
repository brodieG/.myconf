# Base Build

## Basic Setup

    svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/ trunk
    svn cleanup --remove-unversioned
    ./tools/rsync-recommended
    ./configure                # with options
    make

## Quick build

Note: older versions may need older compilers (had issues with qnbinom multiple
definitions with gcc-10 (or so it seemed)).

    make distclean && ./configure --with-recommended-packages=no
    make distclean && ./configure --with-recommended-packages=no\
      --disable-byte-compiled-packages

## Other Useful Flags / Settings

Maechler uses:
* `R_NO_BASE_COMPILE=true` (or --disable-byte-compiled-packages)

More on the CRAN site:

* [Check Configurations][2], in particular:
* [Valgrind config][1]

## Configuration

> Note: docs recommend running `make clean` or `make distclean` after each
> configuration. 

In `config.site` (looks like `make clean` or `make distclean` required to get
changes to register), otherwise need to use envvars.

    CC="gcc-10"
    CFLAGS="-g -O2 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu99" 

Or (note pedantic flag different)

    CC="clang-10"
    CFLAGS="-g -O2 -Wall -Wpedantic -std=gnu99" 

Or to actually get macro expansion in `gdb`

    CFLAGS="-gdwarf -g3 -O0 -Wall -Wpedantic -std=gnu99" 

These should then show up on compilation.

Also putting them in `~/.R/Makevars` does not seem to work (packages only?
r-inst not clear about this).  Edit: there is `Makevars` file in the top level
that might be generated by `configure`, and also one in `etc/Makevars`
apparently.

## Required packages:

### pcre2

```
apt-cache search pcre2               # see what's available
sudo apt-get install libpcre2-8-0    # this alone isn't enough
sudo apt-get install libpcre2-dev    # this did it
```

### Compilers

For later versions of gcc/clang:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
```
# Checking

## Tests

```
make check | tee check.out
make check-devel
make check-all
```
## Compile Checks

### gcc - sanitized

We've been able to build sanitized in clang, but not in gcc because the
undefined behavior sanitizer doesn't seem to work.

See todo in `misc` repo.

### clang - sanitized

config.site config:

    CC="clang -fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-sanitize=float-divide-by-zero -fno-sanitize=alignment -fno-omit-frame-pointer"
    CXX="clang++ -fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-sanitize=float-divide-by-zero -fno-sanitize=alignment -fno-omit-frame-pointer -frtti"
    CFLAGS="-g -O3 -Wall -pedantic"
    FFLAGS="-g -O2 -mtune=native"
    CXXFLAGS="-g -O3 -Wall -pedantic"
    MAIN_LD="clang++ -fsanitize=undefined,address"

### Valgrind
