# Build

## Recommended build

We've found we really want to build things out-of-tree, ultimately succumbing to
good advice because of vagrant issues with in theory blocking system calls (e.g.
mv) on shared folders.  So set-up the following in e.g. /etc/environment:

    RBUILD="/vagrant/home/r-build"
    RSRC="/vagrant/trunk"

After restarting the shell, download the sources

    svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/ $RSRC
    cd $RSRC
    svn cleanup --remove-unversioned
    ./tools/rsync-recommended   # optional

Install R to get all the required packages.  Might require manual installation
of more.  Install required packages (see "Required Packages" below).

    sudo apt-get install r-base-dev

Then configure from the build directory:

    cd $RBUILD
    $RSRC/configure

Or

    cd $RBUILD && $RSRC/configure --with-recommended-packages=no

We've found that building of tree allows us to work around problems with vagrant
and shared folders (we observed `mv` behave in a non-blocking way there starting
in early 2022 breaking reg-packages.R).  So now we build in a separate build
directory.

Or better:

    cd $RBUILD
    make distclean && $RSRC/configure --with-recommended-packages=no
    make

To build the parser gram / bison files:

    cd $RBUILD
    make distclean && $RSRC/configure --enable-maintainer-mode --with-recommended-packages=no
    make

For bison we might require installing `noweb` to get past the `compiler` rebuild:

    sudo apt-get noweb

## Other Useful Flags / Settings

Maechler uses:
* `R_NO_BASE_COMPILE=true` (or --disable-byte-compiled-packages)

More on the CRAN site:

* [Check Configurations][2], in particular:
* [Valgrind config][1]

## Configuration

> Note: docs recommend running `make clean` or `make distclean` after each
> configuration. 

In `config.site` (looks like `make clean` or `make distclean` required to get
changes to register), otherwise need to use envvars.

    CC="gcc-10"
    CFLAGS="-g -O2 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu99" 

Or (note pedantic flag different)

    CC="clang-10"
    CFLAGS="-g -O2 -Wall -Wpedantic -std=gnu99" 

Or to actually get macro expansion in `gdb`

    CFLAGS="-gdwarf -g3 -O0 -Wall -Wpedantic -std=gnu99" 

These should then show up on compilation.

Also putting them in `~/.R/Makevars` does not seem to work (packages only?
r-inst not clear about this).  Edit: there is `Makevars` file in the top level
that might be generated by `configure`, and also one in `etc/Makevars`
apparently. UPDATE: shouldn't these go in `config.site`?

## Required packages:

```
bzip2 cairo fontconfig freetype fribidi gcc gcc-gfortran gcc-c++ glib2
glibc harfbuzz lapack libX11 libXext libXt libcurl libicu libjpeg libpng
libtiff libtirpc libxcrypt ncurses pango pkgconf-pkg-config pcre2
readline tcl tk xz zlib
```

Some of these are installed sufficiently with direct `r-base-dev` install, but
not all.

Then add the `deb-src` (unfortunately we need universe for this):

```
sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-get update
```

Try the more complete install:

```
sudo apt-get build-dep -y r-base-dev
```



```
sudo apt-get install gfortran
sudo apt-get install g++
sudo apt-get install libpcre2-dev    # other versions didn't work
sudo apt-get ibreadline-dev
```


### Compilers

For later versions of gcc/clang:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
```

For standard fortran, c++:

```
```

### Other

```
sudo apt-get install readline
```

# Checking

## Tests

```
make check | tee check.out
make check-devel
make check-all
```
## Compile Checks

### gcc - sanitized

We've been able to build sanitized in clang, but not in gcc because the
undefined behavior sanitizer doesn't seem to work.

See todo in `misc` repo.

### clang - sanitized

config.site config:

    CC="clang -fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-sanitize=float-divide-by-zero -fno-sanitize=alignment -fno-omit-frame-pointer"
    CXX="clang++ -fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-sanitize=float-divide-by-zero -fno-sanitize=alignment -fno-omit-frame-pointer -frtti"
    CFLAGS="-g -O3 -Wall -pedantic"
    FFLAGS="-g -O2 -mtune=native"
    CXXFLAGS="-g -O3 -Wall -pedantic"
    MAIN_LD="clang++ -fsanitize=undefined,address"

### Valgrind
