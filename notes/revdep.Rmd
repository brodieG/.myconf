# Reverse Dependencies

[Mark's Blog](https://www.markvanderloo.eu/yaRb/2019/04/26/checking-reverse-dependencies-the-tiny-way/).

There is a bug in 4.0.3 that means this doesn't work (at least with
`reverse=list(which='most')` (no, this persists even with the empty list)?.

```
result <- tools::check_packages_in_dir(".", reverse = list())
# # most includes suggests, but it seems like it downloads all their recursive
# # suggests too?
result <- tools::check_packages_in_dir(".", reverse = list(which='most'))
summary(result)
```

Main issue we've run into is that automatic rev dep install is from sources,
which is a pain because in many cases source builds require system libraries to
be present.  We do need source packages for what's being tested, but we should
be able to install other stuff from binaries.

Question: does `tools::check_packages_in_dir` insist on installing all recursive
dependencies even when present?  Seems like it does.  It's not satisfied with
with checking whether something is already in the library.  It always
re-installs everything from source.

**However**, if we can bear the time it takes to do this it is okay because the
installs from binary will still be present and work after the installs from
source fails.

So tentative ideal process is:

1. Collect all our reverse imports / depends / (suggests)
2. Collect all their reverse imports etc.
3. Install all of (2.) from binaries in "./Library".  `check_packages_in_dir`
   will try to install all these again fresh, but even if they fail re-install
   it will be fine because they are present in the library.
4. Remove all old checks `rm -r *.Rcheck`
5. Run `result <- tools::check_packages_in_dir(".", reverse = list())`

Need to adapt it to see if we can do all of this in docker image to mitigate the
risk of someone maliciously adding a suggests.

Testing to see if we can install test with binary; don't recall what happened
here.

## Getting revdeps

```
pkg <- 'fansi'
db <- tools::CRAN_package_db()
# dtype <- c('depends', 'imports', 'suggests', 'linking to')
dtype <- c('depends', 'imports', 'linking to')
deps <- unlist(subset(db, Package == pkg)[paste0('Reverse ', dtype)])
bad <- c('mimic.demo', 'eicu.demo')
base <- c(
  "R", "base", "compiler", "datasets", "grDevices", "graphics",
  "grid", "methods", "parallel", "profile", "splines", "stats",
  "stats4", "tcltk", "tools", "utils"
)
clean_name <- function(x) {
  tmp <- unique(trimws(gsub("\\(.*\\)$", "", x)))
  tmp[!tmp %in% c(base, bad)]
}

rev <- unname(unlist(strsplit(deps[!is.na(deps)], ", ")))
## install.packages(
##   rev, lib='./Library', repos='https://cloud.r-project.org', type="both",
##   INSTALL_opts="--install-tests"
## )


deps.rev <- unlist(
  subset(db, Package %in% rev)[
    paste0(c('Depends', 'Imports', 'Suggests', 'LinkingTo'))
  ]
)
rev.rev <- unname(unlist(strsplit(deps.rev[!is.na(deps.rev)], ",[ \n]*")))
rev.rev <- clean_name(rev.rev)
rev.rev <- rev.rev[!rev.rev == 'R']


# this was from a lazy run for diffobj where we tried dumbly first, and saw the
# failed packages
rev.rev <- c('keyring', 'sf', 'tigris', 'rgeos')
install.packages(
  rev.rev, lib='./Library', repos='https://cloud.r-project.org', type="binary"
)

```

## r-lib::revdepcheck

Works relatively well and seems to use the binaries.  Can also specify number of
workers directly.  Just requires a lot of packages, including non-CRAN ones.

Additionally, it needs to install everything from source if running in docker,
so takes a while to even get `revdepcheck` setup.  Not sure if we can avoid
source install in docker?  We should be able with Maruter or the Rstudio
repo, but at least Maruter is only 4.0?

## Docker Container

Commentary from Dirk on how to get started:

> If I were to go that route I would either start from r-base (plain Debian,
> usually in a good state) or with rocker/r-bspm:20.04 (Ubuntu, with 'automagic'
> use of Rutter PPAs via bspm).  More people more at ease with the
> market-leading supplier of all things there is also rocker/r-rspm:20.04
> (Ubuntu plus RSPM; no provision for sys.deps because, well, bspm does that
> already, and better).
