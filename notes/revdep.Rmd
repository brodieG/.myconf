# Reverse Dependencies

[Mark's Blog](https://www.markvanderloo.eu/yaRb/2019/04/26/checking-reverse-dependencies-the-tiny-way/).

```
result <- tools::check_packages_in_dir(".", , reverse = list())
```

For suggests, first install the dependencies for then (is this truly necessary?
The revdep process seems to do it too).  Maybe the problem is that it refuses to
install packages to the new lib that are already installed, but some of them are
out of date.

```
db <- tools::CRAN_package_db()
rev_s <-
  unlist(strsplit(subset(db, Package == 'diffobj')[['Reverse suggests']], ", "))
# rev_ss <- unlist(
#   strsplit(
#     subset(db, Package %in% rev_s)[['Suggests']], "(?:\\s+.*)?,\\s+",
#     perl=TRUE,
# ) )
# 
install.packages(
  rev_s,
  dependencies=c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo", "Suggests"), 
  lib='./Library',
  repos='https://cloud.r-project.org'
)
```

Then:

```
result <- tools::check_packages_in_dir(
  "/Volumes/PERSONAL/repos/revdeptests", , reverse = list(which='Suggests')
)
```
